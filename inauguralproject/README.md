# Inaugural Project - Relative hours spent working at home and in the workplace between the sexes

The primary focus of this project is to examine the differences in time spent working at home and in the workplace between men and women. We use a simple model framework and try to fit the model to some real world estimates.

The project is organized around the 5 questions of the assignment, Q1-Q5.

## Overview
- Introduction
- Q1, Relative time spent working at home
- Q2, Relative wage, discretely
- Q3, Relative wage, continously
- Q4, Fitting the model to parameter estimates
- Q5, Fitting model, equal home productivity
- Conclusion

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/NumEconCopenhagen/projects-2023-mathias-emma-S-ren`
2. Install the required dependencies: only standard packages are being used
3. Run the main script: `Inaugural.ipynb`

## Conclusion
The simple model cannot explain why women use more time working at home than men. With our extention that involves further disutility of working at home for men, we can fit the estimates of Siminski and Yetsenga (2022).
