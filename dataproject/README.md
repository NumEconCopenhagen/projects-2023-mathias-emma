# Data Analysis of Expenditure and Loan in Danish Libraries 

# Project Overview 
This data project investigates the relationship between library expenditure and the number of borrowed books per year across Danish municipalities. We initially import and merge the relevant data, leading to the derivation of per capita figures for both book loans and expenditure in each municipality.

## Key Features

- **Data Integration:** Import and merge data to compute per capita book loans and per capita expenditure in each municipality.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Initial analysis that identifies a negative correlation between expenditure and loans per expenditure.
- **Data Visualization:** Plotting the relationship between expenditure and the number of borrowed books per municipality to discern trends and patterns.
- **Statistical Analysis:** A table showcasing a relatively low, yet positive and statistically significant estimate of the coefficient for per capita expenditure.

## Conclusion 

This project employs data manipulation, statistical analysis, and data visualization to understand the potential relationship between library expenditure and the number of books borrowed. The analysis indicates a positive correlation between expenditure and loans per capita, with a low, yet positive and statistically significant coefficient for per capita expenditure. This suggests that even minor increases in per capita expenditure could influence the number of books borrowed.
