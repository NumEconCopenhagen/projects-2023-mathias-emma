    "In the following simulation, we consider a simplified version of the Solow model with human capital, where we assume a constant population growth rate $n$, savings rate for physical capital $s_k$, human capital $s_h$, technological growth $g$, depreciation rate $\\delta$, capital share $\\alpha$, human capital share $\\phi$, tax rate on physical capital investment $\\tau$, and the effect of human capital on investment $\\eta$. The parameter $\\eta$ in this model represents the fraction of the tax paid on physical capital to the government, which is subsequently allocated to investment in human capital. This allocation of tax revenue towards human capital investment has the potential to stimulate higher levels of overall investment in the economy.\n",

The graph is interactive, which means we can gain insights into the relationship between investment, capital accumulation, human capital development, and economic growth by changing the parameters.\n",

    "The Solow model with human capital highlights the importance of both physical and human capital in driving long-term economic growth. It emphasizes that investing in human capital, such as education and skills development, can have significant positive effects on output and productivity. The model also demonstrates how changes in savings rates, population growth, technological progress, and policies such as taxes can impact the accumulation of capital and human capital, ultimately influencing economic growth rates.\n"

    "In conclusion, the Solow model with human capital has provided valuable insights into the dynamics of economic growth by incorporating the role of human capital and exploring the impact of various parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we identified an analytical solution to the Solow model with human capital, which allowed us to understand the theoretical relationships between savings, production, and the accumulation of physical and human capital. This analytical framework provided a solid foundation for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, we developed a numerical solution to determine the steady-state value of the model. By iteratively calculating the values of capital per effective worker and human capital per effective worker, we were able to identify the long-term equilibrium levels and understand the convergence dynamics of the model. The numerical solution helped us understand how the economy behaves in different situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we introduced a tax on physical capital and examined the effects of allocating tax revenue to human capital investment. This extension of the model allowed us to analyze the impact of fiscal policies on economic growth and resource allocation. By considering the fraction of tax revenue allocated to human capital investment, we explored the potential to enhance investment levels and promote sustainable development through targeted allocations.\n"
