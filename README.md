This repositpory serves as our collection of projects for the course. It provides a overview of our projects and learning progress thorughout the course.

Our repository is divided into four main section:
1. **Inaugural Project** Our first encounter with python, where we apllied basic concepts and implemented initial models.

2. **Data Proejct** A practial exploration of data analysis. We used programming to manage, analyze and visualize data, providing significant interpretations.

3. **Model Project** This project presents our deeper analysis of a more advanced model. It showcases our ability to analyze, solve and vizualize a economic model in python. 

4. **Exam Project** The culmination of our learning journey, this project integrates eveything we have learned thorughout the course.

Each projet has it own folder containing all files relevant, including ipyn, py and README files.
